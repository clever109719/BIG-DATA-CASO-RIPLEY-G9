    "comments": [
      "She's an icon for female strength, and being the underdog.\n\nThe character was initially male, and changed on the strength of sigourneys audition. First bit of female strength took place off screen. \n\nIn a film where gender roles are played with and features androgyny (genderless xenomorph, lambert being changed and ash being nominally \"male\"), she was distinctly female. She wasn't neurotic like lambert, she was assertive without the bravado of parker, and clever without being sly like ash. She was more suspicious than dallas and had a stronger personality than Brett. She had an interview sense of authority and respect; parker was disrespectful to her at the start; by the end he rescued her and followed her. Maybe she was able to accurately read the situation; the only other one who did was Ash, but he was a synthetic who worked for the company.\n\nWomen at that time had less rights than men certainly in the US where access to credit cards was largely denied. The apparently enlightened 60s challenged gender norms which manifested distinctly glam rock (ziggy stardust also being an androgynous alien but im beginning to digress). 4With the advent of punk in 1976 and just before the eighties attitudes were changing towards female roles in society. Even in star wars, women were princesses and feminine. Star trek was largely absent for the 70s and women were minor in a space odyssey. Ripley filled an empty space for women in sci-fi. She was assertive and feminine. That's not just the writing, that the performance as well. She's not classically good looking but had a sexuality to her, like many others. She's relatable to women, children who grew up around or shortly after this come out and LGBTQ community as a symbol of strength. She was a survivor in a distinctly masculine environment, as many working environments are. \n\nShe was unlikely; she had only done one film before this as an actress (less than most of the romulus cast), and was the youngest so she wasnt known. She seemed to be a stickler for rules, but ultimately that served her right. The patriarchy tried to dominate her (ash for breaching quarantine and forcibly assaulting her, dallas for ignoring her concerns, parker for not acknowleging her authoirty) and ended up outliving all them despite the obstacles. Most that sympathise with her have felt marginalised or been made to feel see through sympathise I would say. She showed the right judgement in a bad situation. Its what we all want to beleive we can do as well. \n\nThat's my take on it from a distance.",
      "She personifies realistic feminine strength. I think modern film has a tendency for the action to showcase a women’s strengths (e.g. physical strength, hand to hand combat, etc)  Whereas in Alien and Aliens, Ripleys character isn’t a soldier, she isn’t gifted with special powers, she’s just a strong woman that perseveres some crazy shit. And she becomes all of those things (fighter, savior, etc) leading first with who she is and how strong she is as a person and woman. ",
      "More than anything else I think she’s the first person I ever saw in a horror movie who always did exactly what a reasonable audience member would do. Let the infected person back on the ship? NO. Fire a flamethrower blindly down hallways before you run down them? YES. Nuke the site from orbit because it’s the only way to be sure? HELL YES! \n\nShe never loses her shit, never does anything stupid, but she’s never anything less than believable no matter what emotion she has to convey. Her gender is not relevant, her humanity is. Like the best protagonists, everyone could identify with her, feel for her, and breathe a sigh of relief when she finally… OH MY GOD IT’s IN THE ESCAPE POD!\n\nAll due to respect to Weaver, Ripley the character is the product of great writing, directing, and acting, all of which was used to great effect to convince us of what we always suspected was true as children: that monsters are real",
      "Like all of the best female iconic characters, they’re basically written as male and then changed to female, this is what modern Hollywood doesn’t understand, girl power nonsense doesn’t work because it doesn’t fit into the reality of the world we live in, even in superhero movies (particularly the first ten years of the mcu) the there’s still some degree of bringing something obviously unrealistic but somehow makes it feel as grounded to reality as it can be, this is good example why the DC movies that aren’t Batman constantly fail, the characters never look natural even at being superhuman, anyway… a 90lb girl constantly knocking down 200lb stuntmen’s in a swing of a baseball bat that in real life wouldn’t even make them flinch simply doesn’t look good and isn’t believable, with ripley, and Sarah Connor etc etc we never see them do anything that is so unrealistic it completely disengages your brain from some form of realistic expectation of what you’re seeing..\n\nGranted this is not the best explanation and I’m sure someone can expand on that in a much more intellectual way, but that’s the best I can do.",
      "People bitch about misogyny \n\nI love Sci-fi\n\nTwo greatest heroes \n\nSarah Conner\n\nEllen Ripley\n\nThen, after all that, Dutch in Predator",
      "Without taking anything away from what people have said about female strength, I would add: the characters we find on the Nostromo are a wonderfully authentic collection of blue/gray collar workers. Every one of them seems like a person you could actually meet in a blue/gray collar business in your town. Ripley, in addition to representing female strength, genuinely feels like a normal person (not a superhero) who has encountered something horrifying that she has no choice but to confront. She can't \"use the force\" or rely on a super-strong cyborg sidekick, she's a regular person, on her own. This helps make her enduringly iconic and is the result of great writing, great directing and great acting.",
      "All other 70's and 80's badasses were bidimensional by comparison, without fear, without emotions... The audience can relate to that only to an extent, they can fantasize being like that but really can't relate that much with them\n\nWhat makes Ripley the utlimate basass is that she was a badass DESPITE being scared, Before that (and also after throughout the 80's) the hero almost always was some sort of unfeeling ubermensch, think 007 or all the macho action movies from the 60's-80's era, a dude that can manage every situation, always cool and always in control. \n\nIn Alien that part is given to the antagonist, and the protagonist is YOU, with all your fear, with all your lack of knowledge and expertise, just a young junior officer facing the ultimate threat. That's what makes Ripley an iconic character in my opinion.",
      "Ripley was just an average person thrown into an impossible situation and used her wits to get out of it. No hand to hand nonsense fighting with something unkillable. Who could not love that?",
      "Ripley makes the right decisions (often fighting against incompetent or corrupt superiors)\n\n\nShe shows strong leadership without being insufferable.\n\n\nAnd she is obviously magnificently brave and tenacious, without being a comic book caricature.",
      "Sigourney Weaver’s acting is the bulk of Ripley’s charm. Each movie gives a different look at the character. \n\nFrom her no nonsense by-the-books survivor in Alien, her more vulnerable bereaved mother-turned-action hero in Aliens, her got-nothing-to-lose presence in Alien 3, and finally her batshit Alien in human skin performance in Alien Resurrection.\n\nThe writing in these movies treats the character differently, but the core of Ellen Ripley endures thanks to Sigourney Weaver’s acting. You can’t have Ripley without Sigourney Weaver.",
      "If you look at popular characters who achieve iconic status, you get basically three elements that make them compelling:\n\n\\-they are good at \"their thing\" and this is established early in a film\n\n\\-they are vulnerable in a compelling and understandable way\n\n\\-they achieve victory (however pyrrhic) at a high cost in pain that they endure\n\nAs an example, The Man With No Name from A Fistful of Dollars. He's a badass gunslinger, he's badly outnumbered, he gets the absolute shit kicked out of him and has to crawl away before he can stage a comeback. Iconic, memorable character. \n\nFor Ripley, she clearly knows her business as a space trucker, she's up against a biomechanical horror from the depths of the void, she goes through an emotionally and physically stressful ordeal to barely eke out a victory. \n\nEvery Jackie Chan character basically follows this formula too as his sort of \"movie star\" persona - he's good at fighting, he's always outnumbered or outgunned or outmatched, and he has to climb what he calls a \"ladder of pain\" before he wins in a fight.",
      "You‘re absolutely right, but Ellen Ripley was originally written as a male character. Ridley Scott decided to make the character female during the casting process. According to Scott, the suggestion to change the character's gender came from Alan Ladd Jr., then president of 20th Century Fox. This change resulted in Ripley becoming one of the most iconic and celebrated female protagonists in science fiction.",
      "If you've seen the original script. The male characters were all placeholders and the script actually specified that gender was interchangeable. People act like Ripley was *meant* to be male, but none of the film characters names are actually in the script.",
      "Too many movies make the mistake of having their “strong female character” just a dude with boobs. They are trying to inject masculinity into the female character, when they would have been better off just casting a man. Ripley’s strength is her femininity, and her intelligence. And it’s so much more formidable than a woman with physical brawn.",
      "??? There’s something inherently iconic about a trailblazer, & Sigourney’s acting was excellent. Showing not just that women can be strong - like the mom in Terminator - but they can be that, the smartest person in the room, *and still have* feminine qualities, which she shows in nurturing Newt & generally being a badass in Aliens. \n\nPlus, Alien has a lived-in feel that is just rare these days. Simple sets like the crew all having breakfast together, trading jokes - you don’t see much of that day-to-day reality in a lot of sci-fi. \n\nCall it member-berries, but you’re wild to think Ripley doesn’t *deserve* her status as the original bad ass woman in sci-fi. The franchise just would not have endured this long without her (no shade against the modern casts!) \n\nI’m not a boomer, and really only got deep into the series in fall of 2024. \n\nI’m sure other fans can word this better than I, but TL,DR: you’re whack."

      "I get so sick and tired of people taking points away from Ellen Ripley due to her character not originally being female, and I don’t know what you’re talking about when it comes to her femininity not being “shoved in your face.”  We see her as a strong leader in Alien, but when people think back to her character’s most defining moments, so much of her badassery happens during the sequel, Aliens.  In that movie her being a female is well-established, a considerable portion of her character arc is based off her surrogate motherhood of Newt, she acts as a flirtatious interest to Hicks, and with all that femininity *she is the most badass character in the movie.*",
      "It’s a common misconception that Ripley was written as a male character. In reality all of the characters were written without gender specified as last names only originally. Alien is the most fascinating gender/sex case study, because the whole premise is to disturb men with SA by the Alien, and make them gestate an organism. Anyway….\nBeatrix Kiddo\n\nSidney Prescott \n\nSam and Tara Carpenter \n\nFuriosa \n\nHarley Quinn\n\nKatniss Everdeen\n\nFox (Jolie in Wanted)\n\nLaura Croft \n\nCrystal (The Hunt)\n\nJyn Erso",
      "I don't know why strong women characters have to be physically strong. Female versions of male characters. Ripley wasn't a great chracter because she was physically strong, it was because she was smart, a natural leader, caring, made good decisions... One of my favourite characters ever. \n\nDon't make a woman strong by making her physically strong. Don't make her strong by making her say 'suck my dick'. Don't make her strong by making everyone around her weak or stupid. Make her strong in the ways that so many women in real life are strong.",
      "Its because she show courage. Shes knows shes way over her head and is scared stiff, but pushes on. Jodie Foster kicked that role's full ass.\n\nHer adversary wasnt simply the case, but men. She had to fight through rampant sexism, sexual advances, and sexual assault. You could replace Ellen Ripley with a male lead and the result wouldve been the same. Human against Alien. Clarice had to be a woman for the movie to work. Shes the definition of a strong female lead.",
      "My favourite thing about her is how we see her transformation across the two films - starting out as a regular girl working a waitress job, but then going through some serious psychological trauma that she has to either deal with or be broken by... and she chooses to deal with it.\n\n\"You're terminated, fucker\" on paper could be a horrendously cheesy 80s action movie one liner, but her delivery of that line is just so, so perfect. That precise moment is when the real Sarah Connor is born - when she realises she has the strength to fight back.\n\nThen, in T2, she risks losing her humanity as she becomes terminator-like herself in her quest to kill Miles Dyson and avert the war... It's only when she's confronted by her own son that she realises that she - and by extension humanity - is not the same as the Terminators, and there are some lines that can't be crossed.\n\nIf you take both films as one, her story arc is absolutely magnificent and perfectly portrayed by Linda Hamilton.\n\nRipley will always be the goat, but Sarah Connor will always be my favourite.",

      "I'm going to mention the ones that I don't see either option equally or plausible in further storytelling:\n\n* Rhea Ripley vs Iyo Sky vs Bianca Belair: If Iyo doesn't retain Wrestlemania itself wouldn't be ruined but the story beyond would be seriously damaged. Rhea is my all time favourite women's wrestler but she agreed to drop the title for a reason imo.\n* Gunther vs Jey Uso: If Jey won't win why did we set this match in the first place? If Gunther had to retain he could have someone a lot more established and proven for that person to put them over. But again it wouldn't be end of the world if we are to take it Wrestlemania-specific.\n* Tiffany Stratton vs Charlotte Flair: This is my strongest opinion, TIFFY HAS TO WIN!!! Charlotte carried the feud horribly and ripping the title off from a 25 year old full timer is just criminal. This would actually create Dominik Mysterio level boos.\n* LA Knight vs Jacob Fatu: The only way I see LA Knight(YEAH!!!) retaining is Solo somehow getting involved, ruining the match for Jacob and causing Jacob to turn babyface. But still Jacob Fatu is my horse in this race.\n* AJ Styles vs Logan Paul: I don't want yet another Logan Paul win against hard working full timers, simple as.\n* Rey Mysterio vs El Grande Americano: El Grande Americano has to get unmasked in this match and that makes sense if Rey wins. But the opposite can be worked out with Rey getting infuriated and losing grip etc.",
      "Logan Paul, Charlotte, and Rhea Ripley winning would all suck",
      "Good reasoning OP... I'm heading in to wrestlemania thinking this...\n\nCody/Cena: Cody. I kind of think something may happen where Randy gets his chance and dethrones The American Nightmare, giving him # 15, maybe even a back/forth... getting him to 16, and have Cena 'Shake the hand of who gets # 17, and surpasses him before the door hits him on the way out :) '.\n\nPunk/Reigns/Rollins: I am hoping for ROLLINS. But I'd like them to add a piece to the match. Put Paul Heyman in a cage, and whoever wins retains his services. (Rollins/Heyman could be freakin fun lol! Furthermore, it places Rollins continuously within the warpath of either way how the Dub wants to run it... Reigns or Punk would want retribution at Backlash.\n\nSky/Ripley/Belair: I am hoping for SKY. She could add so much to her resume coming out on top at a triple threat Wrestlemania, involving those 2 women. The way she has been thrown about, she needs to make the exclamation point for the smaller sized women on the roster (the Liv's and Lyra's)... They can still throw down. Kinda vital, when Giulia and Steph Vacquer are on their way... I could see this set up Giulia's promotion to the next level (fighting Joshi style with IYO).\n\nGunther/Jey: Hurmmmm..... Honestly this could be one heck of a legendary match... If Gunther retains. But I do think they're strapping Jey up at Wrestlemania. He's simply earned the chance to run based on how over he has gotten with the fans. The Sales need to matter, because it's what the guys are always saying what matter. (well, that, and POP... Jey's proven that he's got that too).\n\nStratton/Flair: Gotta say STRATTON. I do think Flair is trying to put her over as well.. She knows the whole background thing, I am sure these girls are just cooking an entertaining as anything story right now. Stratton I think they're building to be Flair's true successor... Not that Charlotte is going anywhere right now... But She will have another moment to stap the belt on... and this is a great opportunity to endorse the hard work Trish has put in... Which is very reminiscient of Charlotte Flair. I mean, they're even wearing the same outfits lol!\n\nKnight/Fatu: I see a swerve happening. KNIGHT retains. I agree with OP's opinion that there's flesh on opening up a Solo/Bloodline feud, which might be an amazing cook out. Knight retains at WM , has his moment under the lights... There's plenty of time and enemies to dethrone him through out the next year... Maybe be in the running for a MITB, or large title run. Jacob winning this just FEELS a little too obvious.\n\nIC Fatal 4-way... Bron/Penta/Dom/Finn: This is another one I think is kind of story driven (like LA's belt)... Perhaps the breakup of the Judgement Day? FINN I think may walk out as Champ. I think the big story will be Dom somehow helping Penta, or the other way around. Bron's ready to elevate, and he is a shoe in for being within Gunther/Jey post Wrestlemania. After they need their cool-down. I think Dom's ready for some bigger moments as well... \n\nJade/Naomi: I can't imagine Naomi getting throttled again at the hands of Jade, at a PLE event premium match again. It's another curious one however, because the element to swerve is definitely there. If The triple threat match is on a different night... I could see this match spoiling the triple threat chances of Bianca Belair (having her go full heel turn). Jade loses, but doesn't look bad in doing so, and sets the run to a Jade/Bianca show down... Somewhere down the line.\n\nStyles/Paul: I gotta feeling this one will go to STYLES. He is being severely underplayed around the WWE, and it's time to remind the universe, who is the phenomanal one really is. I believe it'll be a 5-star though... To further build up Logan's resume. I mean, it's ok to have that moment with Ricochet... But the dub can't go on that anymore... I got a feeling this one will have it's moments.\n\nel Grande Americano/Rey Mysterio: hmmm... Tough call what's going on here. But I do think this IS the Gable push that may go somewhere (why else add it to Wrestlemania?) EL GRANDE AMERICANO takes it, and I dont think it will be close. (he may cut a corner or 2)... But Gable looks jacked, there's a reason for it... as for Rey, I'm not sure where he goes entirely... But perhaps this sets him on course to his retirement match (he has said he wants Dom to retire him... I think the Dub will honor that... Word is that he's considering it...)\n\nThe question will be... Who will be the surprises? Stone Cold? The Rock? Becky Lynch? Taker? & where do they fit in to the equation? :)\n\nI have a lot of run-ins... I doubt they're all happening... Just thought where I could see the potential for it.",
      "Rhea Ripley taking home the gold. It would be the least interesting outcome I think. And DQ win for any of these would just be sour as hell.",

      "1. Charlotte winning that's a big one she don't need another one and tired of seeing younger stars get buried \n\n2. Jade and Naomi not opening this match isn't mania worthy and we don't need it in the middle we don't even need it at all this would've been good for bad blood instead \n\n3. Rhea winning I love Rhea but these recent events made her seem desperate we all knew this was gonna go triple threat there was no point in continuing with iyo and Ripley for the title a couple Mondays ago seeing how it was playing out I personally just wanted to see Bianca and iyo and I'm fine with either of them two winning but if Rhea wins that's cool I guess she's still mami \n\n4. Cena not putting his money where his mouth is he better put on a good show and bring that energy with him bc Cody giving him a cross roads with no struggle was like \"that's it?\"",
      "Outcomes that would ruin it......\n\nCharlotte Flair winning (she dont need it)\n\nRhea Ripley winning (sorry shes eating the pin)\n\nFinn Balor winning (hes eating the pin)\n\nLiv Morgan & Raquel Rodriguez losing the belts to any team but Damage CTRL and Wyatt Sicks\n\nNow Naomi beating Cargill would not ruin it for me but it would hurt Jade who needs it more",
      "Here's what I'd like to see:\n\nCena wins and absolutely brutalizes Cody\n\nSomeone else mentioned that Heyman in a cage with the winner getting his services would be cool and I wholeheartedly agree. I just don't like any of the three of them, but I dislike Rollins the most, so I'm hoping Punk wins.\n\nSky needs to keep the belt, Ripley and Belair have been disrespecting her way too much.\n\nI want Jey to win, Gunther is just uninteresting to me\n\nIC Title I think should go to Penta or Dom, but I don't like Dom at all so I want Penta to win. Bron should move up. I think Bron vs Jey would be great to watch.\n\nI'm hoping Logan Paul trips on the entrance ramp and breaks his femur so I don't have to see him again for at least a year. Even better if he's out of wrestling for good. Otherwise I hope Styles just squashes him, Logan Paul is a terrible human being and should just go away.\n\nAs mush as I hate the gimmick, I think El Grande Americano will beat Rey Mysterio.\n\nI don't want Smackdown, so I have no opinion on those matches",
      "Rhoads winning. \nFlair winning.\nDiarrhea Ripley winning. \nLA Knight losing \nPenta winning. \nThe Cargill vs Naomi match actually happening. I guarantee it’s gonna be worse than the Uso’s match last year."

    "comments": [
      "Real excited. I’ve been going through all the older adaptations (Purple Moon, The American Friend, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and Ripley’s Game), and they’ve all been pretty great except for Ripley’s Game, so I have a good feeling.",
      "I think I'm only 4 episodes in, but am enjoying it. It looks great and Andrew Scott is very good. I think my main issues with it are Marge and Dickie and Freddy casting, you just cant replace Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow and Phillip Seymour Hoffman and expect to come out on top. And trying to find the purpose of the series altogether. So far we've followed the original film's plot pretty steadfastly. We've still got 4 hours to go and I'm not sure how they're going to fill them. It's tough when you make a series adaptation out of a perfect movie, you gotta really try and make it different to justify your existence. I am not seeing that yet. They probably should've just adapted a different Ripley novel.",
      "The problem for me is how long it's taking to show the alien or get to the horror elements of Ripley. I understand that it's set hundreds of years before the original Aliens movies starring Ripley, but the shift away from horror to noir is really throwing me off.",
      "I’ll give it a watch but the reports of Scott playing him as a straight-ahead cold sociopath after Damon’s shockingly empathetic Ripley make me wary.",
      "I don’t like TV most of the time, especially not prestige limited series, but it’s the best new thing I’ve watched this year. I think it’s incredibly successful and I just hope that Zallion and Elswit are down to dedicate the next 5 years to this project. I love Ripley movies, and it’s my second favorite version after Plein Soleil.",
      "It's such a fun set to run through!\nFor me, including the wonderful and bizarre Ripley's Game.",
      "I think the original plan was to adapt the whole Ripley series, one book per season.",
      "I watched the first two and I agree with the casting being a big issue. I found Dakota Fanning to be good (I also don't like Paltrow in general), but wow does Johnny Flynn feel miscast. I don't know if he's not a particularly good actor or what but his line reads just were bothering me. Like he never once came off as someone I'd want to hangout with, let alone become; whereas Jude Law in Talented Mr Ripley is absurdly handsome, charming, and likable. Don't even get me started on the replacement for Phillip Seymour Hoffman, just not even close. Also I was confused if Freddie is supposed to be trans in this? It would be odd due to the time period, but like that's clearly a biological woman and to not have it acknowledged by Ripley seemed weird to me.",
      "That might be interesting. Part of what I like is how (previously) each Ripley interpretation on the screen was slightly different. Ripley in Purple Noon is not quite the Ripley from TTMR. Neither are like Underground. And then of course Malkovitch's older Ripley who has gotten colder with age.\n\nThe first three eps of this are essentially beat for beat from TTMR, with some scenes practically word for word lifted. Weird choice to make since you're going to invite comparison to Paltrow/Law/Hoffman/Damon, and you can't really beat that. \n\nI have to give credit to Scott and Fanning though, they rose to the occasion. I'm also enjoying the later episodes a lot more, which are largely Andrew Scott/Ripley focused.",
      "I disagree I don't think you need to have the character be trans, the actor might be but who cares. It's all imagination. But my issue like you said is none of the actors here can hold a candle to their counterparts in the Talented Mr Ripley.",
      "It was a Showtime series that got sold to Netflix after Paramount’s troubles. I remember it being announced as a complete adaptation of all the Ripley books on the trades. Also, that’s probably the reason why they went with an older actor, being that in future books there’s a time jump.",
      "I get your point, but with the time period it's set it just breaks the immersion. Literally one throwaway line could have solved my issue (unless this happens later in the series) but someone like Ripley insulting Freddie but not acknowledging the gender doesn't make any logical sense. Literally just Ripley saying \"Was Freddie a woman?\" \"He gets that a lot\". Boom problem solved."

      "**Match 3: Finn Balor v. AJ Styles -** This is like catnip to me. In my limited time as a wrestling fan, I’ve gone through both AJ and Finn’s NJPW runs, and developed such a strong affection for them as performers. This entire match was just seeing two masters have a sparring match. It was never going to be a five star classic, but it was a good solid fun time. Add the little tease about Penta… and I’m interested in where this goes. **8.**\n\nBecky promo - It’s difficult to hear another “you people” promo when the main story of the company is a “you people” promo, but I actually like Becky’s delivery, and understand her story in a way that feels more riveting than the Cena stuff right now. It’s at this point that the crowd became completely intolerable to me, but Becky gave a great promo regardless. The build at the end felt equal parts triumphant and grand, and I’m excited to see where she goes. **9.**  \n  \nRusev package - It’s fun. But it was a little hard to follow, and it’s hard to feel… a grand sense of his purpose and aura when he beat up Tozawa. **2.** \n\nTozawa/Sheamus segments - Hearing Tozawa want to fight Rusev sounds alright, but fun. Hearing Sheamus say he wants to fight Grayson Waller upon coming back is like seeing Max Verstappen decide to drive a Vespa. That’s not why I’m interested in y’all. Rough. **3.**   \n  \n**Match 4: Iyo Sky & Rhea Ripley v. Giulia & Roxanne Perez** \\- This match allowed me to put some of my more complicated thoughts about Rhea Ripley into words. She’s an excellent character with an instantly iconic look to her, and in ring she’s great at destroying people, when taking bumps or selling, everything looks a little too preplanned, a little too rehearsed. It causes her in ring work to feel frictionless to me. I wonder if this comes from a lack of trust in her partners, which makes sense given her injuries. But I see the way Giulia, Roxanne and Iyo let themselves get hit, and naturally move with the impact, rather than over exaggerate an impact that did not actually happen. This match did solidify to me though that Roxanne is going to be a star, and Giulia and Iyo are one day going to have an all timer. But as for this match… it may as well have been an exhibition. **6.**  \n  \n\\[PART 2/?\\]",
      "People also take Rhea's level of starpower for granted even though it's genuinely rare for someone to just keep getting more and more popular over a three-year period. (There were clear signs before then, like [how they had to change her storyline with Shayna based on the crowd reaction for her first NXT promo](https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/rhea-ripley/cover-story-from-adelaide-to-anomaly-the-rise-of-rhea-ripley), but her interrupting the Mysterio 20th Anniversary party was the moment where Rhea arrived) And she's been able to sustain and grow that popularity even after moving from her unique hybrid role leading Judgment Day to solely being a women's division performer. It's very impressive. To put it in perspective, even Becky's historic run as The Man only lasted around eighteen months and happened at a time when the company was much colder than today.",
      "And brand new Giulia was also in the ring with Rhea Ripley, arguably the biggest female star in the WWE. This will definitely not hurt those two, it only helps.",
      "She's fucking Rhea Ripley, I mean, just look at her and look at Roxanne and Giulia. Why should she be handing jobs to everyone and their mother? Roxanne should be thankful Rhea sold so much for her in their match last week, last month, whatever day it was",
      "That sounds like a booking problem, not a Rhea Ripley problem. Is it a problem when the Men's world title is on any of their top stars?",
      "Then that's a booking problem, not a Rhea Ripley problem."

Ahora con la estafa yo creo que lo único que procede es denunciar la suplantación de identidad ante la pdi o directamente con fiscalia, de todas formas si no pagas y Ripley quiere perseguir el crédito, tendrían que iniciar procedimientos judiciales de cobro y ahi se podria alegar mejor si ya tienes una denuncia por suplantación de identidad",

Ahora con la estafa yo creo que lo único que procede es denunciar la suplantación de identidad ante la pdi o directamente con fiscalia, de todas formas si no pagas y Ripley quiere perseguir el crédito, tendrían que iniciar procedimientos judiciales de cobro y ahi se podria alegar mejor si ya tienes una denuncia por suplantación de identidad",

    "title": "In your opinion, what makes Ripley so enduringly iconic?",
    "comments": [
      "She's an icon for female strength, and being the underdog.\n\nThe character was initially male, and changed on the strength of sigourneys audition. First bit of female strength took place off screen. \n\nIn a film where gender roles are played with and features androgyny (genderless xenomorph, lambert being changed and ash being nominally \"male\"), she was distinctly female. She wasn't neurotic like lambert, she was assertive without the bravado of parker, and clever without being sly like ash. She was more suspicious than dallas and had a stronger personality than Brett. She had an interview sense of authority and respect; parker was disrespectful to her at the start; by the end he rescued her and followed her. Maybe she was able to accurately read the situation; the only other one who did was Ash, but he was a synthetic who worked for the company.\n\nWomen at that time had less rights than men certainly in the US where access to credit cards was largely denied. The apparently enlightened 60s challenged gender norms which manifested distinctly glam rock (ziggy stardust also being an androgynous alien but im beginning to digress). 4With the advent of punk in 1976 and just before the eighties attitudes were changing towards female roles in society. Even in star wars, women were princesses and feminine. Star trek was largely absent for the 70s and women were minor in a space odyssey. Ripley filled an empty space for women in sci-fi. She was assertive and feminine. That's not just the writing, that the performance as well. She's not classically good looking but had a sexuality to her, like many others. She's relatable to women, children who grew up around or shortly after this come out and LGBTQ community as a symbol of strength. She was a survivor in a distinctly masculine environment, as many working environments are. \n\nShe was unlikely; she had only done one film before this as an actress (less than most of the romulus cast), and was the youngest so she wasnt known. She seemed to be a stickler for rules, but ultimately that served her right. The patriarchy tried to dominate her (ash for breaching quarantine and forcibly assaulting her, dallas for ignoring her concerns, parker for not acknowleging her authoirty) and ended up outliving all them despite the obstacles. Most that sympathise with her have felt marginalised or been made to feel see through sympathise I would say. She showed the right judgement in a bad situation. Its what we all want to beleive we can do as well. \n\nThat's my take on it from a distance.",
      "She personifies realistic feminine strength. I think modern film has a tendency for the action to showcase a women’s strengths (e.g. physical strength, hand to hand combat, etc)  Whereas in Alien and Aliens, Ripleys character isn’t a soldier, she isn’t gifted with special powers, she’s just a strong woman that perseveres some crazy shit. And she becomes all of those things (fighter, savior, etc) leading first with who she is and how strong she is as a person and woman. ",
      "More than anything else I think she’s the first person I ever saw in a horror movie who always did exactly what a reasonable audience member would do. Let the infected person back on the ship? NO. Fire a flamethrower blindly down hallways before you run down them? YES. Nuke the site from orbit because it’s the only way to be sure? HELL YES! \n\nShe never loses her shit, never does anything stupid, but she’s never anything less than believable no matter what emotion she has to convey. Her gender is not relevant, her humanity is. Like the best protagonists, everyone could identify with her, feel for her, and breathe a sigh of relief when she finally… OH MY GOD IT’s IN THE ESCAPE POD!\n\nAll due to respect to Weaver, Ripley the character is the product of great writing, directing, and acting, all of which was used to great effect to convince us of what we always suspected was true as children: that monsters are real",
      "Like all of the best female iconic characters, they’re basically written as male and then changed to female, this is what modern Hollywood doesn’t understand, girl power nonsense doesn’t work because it doesn’t fit into the reality of the world we live in, even in superhero movies (particularly the first ten years of the mcu) the there’s still some degree of bringing something obviously unrealistic but somehow makes it feel as grounded to reality as it can be, this is good example why the DC movies that aren’t Batman constantly fail, the characters never look natural even at being superhuman, anyway… a 90lb girl constantly knocking down 200lb stuntmen’s in a swing of a baseball bat that in real life wouldn’t even make them flinch simply doesn’t look good and isn’t believable, with ripley, and Sarah Connor etc etc we never see them do anything that is so unrealistic it completely disengages your brain from some form of realistic expectation of what you’re seeing..\n\nGranted this is not the best explanation and I’m sure someone can expand on that in a much more intellectual way, but that’s the best I can do.",
      "People bitch about misogyny \n\nI love Sci-fi\n\nTwo greatest heroes \n\nSarah Conner\n\nEllen Ripley\n\nThen, after all that, Dutch in Predator",
      "Without taking anything away from what people have said about female strength, I would add: the characters we find on the Nostromo are a wonderfully authentic collection of blue/gray collar workers. Every one of them seems like a person you could actually meet in a blue/gray collar business in your town. Ripley, in addition to representing female strength, genuinely feels like a normal person (not a superhero) who has encountered something horrifying that she has no choice but to confront. She can't \"use the force\" or rely on a super-strong cyborg sidekick, she's a regular person, on her own. This helps make her enduringly iconic and is the result of great writing, great directing and great acting.",
      "All other 70's and 80's badasses were bidimensional by comparison, without fear, without emotions... The audience can relate to that only to an extent, they can fantasize being like that but really can't relate that much with them\n\nWhat makes Ripley the utlimate basass is that she was a badass DESPITE being scared, Before that (and also after throughout the 80's) the hero almost always was some sort of unfeeling ubermensch, think 007 or all the macho action movies from the 60's-80's era, a dude that can manage every situation, always cool and always in control. \n\nIn Alien that part is given to the antagonist, and the protagonist is YOU, with all your fear, with all your lack of knowledge and expertise, just a young junior officer facing the ultimate threat. That's what makes Ripley an iconic character in my opinion.",
      "Ripley was just an average person thrown into an impossible situation and used her wits to get out of it. No hand to hand nonsense fighting with something unkillable. Who could not love that?",
      "Ripley makes the right decisions (often fighting against incompetent or corrupt superiors)\n\n\nShe shows strong leadership without being insufferable.\n\n\nAnd she is obviously magnificently brave and tenacious, without being a comic book caricature.",
      "Sigourney Weaver’s acting is the bulk of Ripley’s charm. Each movie gives a different look at the character. \n\nFrom her no nonsense by-the-books survivor in Alien, her more vulnerable bereaved mother-turned-action hero in Aliens, her got-nothing-to-lose presence in Alien 3, and finally her batshit Alien in human skin performance in Alien Resurrection.\n\nThe writing in these movies treats the character differently, but the core of Ellen Ripley endures thanks to Sigourney Weaver’s acting. You can’t have Ripley without Sigourney Weaver.",
      "If you look at popular characters who achieve iconic status, you get basically three elements that make them compelling:\n\n\\-they are good at \"their thing\" and this is established early in a film\n\n\\-they are vulnerable in a compelling and understandable way\n\n\\-they achieve victory (however pyrrhic) at a high cost in pain that they endure\n\nAs an example, The Man With No Name from A Fistful of Dollars. He's a badass gunslinger, he's badly outnumbered, he gets the absolute shit kicked out of him and has to crawl away before he can stage a comeback. Iconic, memorable character. \n\nFor Ripley, she clearly knows her business as a space trucker, she's up against a biomechanical horror from the depths of the void, she goes through an emotionally and physically stressful ordeal to barely eke out a victory. \n\nEvery Jackie Chan character basically follows this formula too as his sort of \"movie star\" persona - he's good at fighting, he's always outnumbered or outgunned or outmatched, and he has to climb what he calls a \"ladder of pain\" before he wins in a fight.",
      "You‘re absolutely right, but Ellen Ripley was originally written as a male character. Ridley Scott decided to make the character female during the casting process. According to Scott, the suggestion to change the character's gender came from Alan Ladd Jr., then president of 20th Century Fox. This change resulted in Ripley becoming one of the most iconic and celebrated female protagonists in science fiction.",
      "If you've seen the original script. The male characters were all placeholders and the script actually specified that gender was interchangeable. People act like Ripley was *meant* to be male, but none of the film characters names are actually in the script.",
      "Too many movies make the mistake of having their “strong female character” just a dude with boobs. They are trying to inject masculinity into the female character, when they would have been better off just casting a man. Ripley’s strength is her femininity, and her intelligence. And it’s so much more formidable than a woman with physical brawn.",
      "??? There’s something inherently iconic about a trailblazer, & Sigourney’s acting was excellent. Showing not just that women can be strong - like the mom in Terminator - but they can be that, the smartest person in the room, *and still have* feminine qualities, which she shows in nurturing Newt & generally being a badass in Aliens. \n\nPlus, Alien has a lived-in feel that is just rare these days. Simple sets like the crew all having breakfast together, trading jokes - you don’t see much of that day-to-day reality in a lot of sci-fi. \n\nCall it member-berries, but you’re wild to think Ripley doesn’t *deserve* her status as the original bad ass woman in sci-fi. The franchise just would not have endured this long without her (no shade against the modern casts!) \n\nI’m not a boomer, and really only got deep into the series in fall of 2024. \n\nI’m sure other fans can word this better than I, but TL,DR: you’re whack."

    "comments": [
      "I get so sick and tired of people taking points away from Ellen Ripley due to her character not originally being female, and I don’t know what you’re talking about when it comes to her femininity not being “shoved in your face.”  We see her as a strong leader in Alien, but when people think back to her character’s most defining moments, so much of her badassery happens during the sequel, Aliens.  In that movie her being a female is well-established, a considerable portion of her character arc is based off her surrogate motherhood of Newt, she acts as a flirtatious interest to Hicks, and with all that femininity *she is the most badass character in the movie.*",
      "It’s a common misconception that Ripley was written as a male character. In reality all of the characters were written without gender specified as last names only originally. Alien is the most fascinating gender/sex case study, because the whole premise is to disturb men with SA by the Alien, and make them gestate an organism. Anyway….\nBeatrix Kiddo\n\nSidney Prescott \n\nSam and Tara Carpenter \n\nFuriosa \n\nHarley Quinn\n\nKatniss Everdeen\n\nFox (Jolie in Wanted)\n\nLaura Croft \n\nCrystal (The Hunt)\n\nJyn Erso",
      "I don't know why strong women characters have to be physically strong. Female versions of male characters. Ripley wasn't a great chracter because she was physically strong, it was because she was smart, a natural leader, caring, made good decisions... One of my favourite characters ever. \n\nDon't make a woman strong by making her physically strong. Don't make her strong by making her say 'suck my dick'. Don't make her strong by making everyone around her weak or stupid. Make her strong in the ways that so many women in real life are strong.",
      "Its because she show courage. Shes knows shes way over her head and is scared stiff, but pushes on. Jodie Foster kicked that role's full ass.\n\nHer adversary wasnt simply the case, but men. She had to fight through rampant sexism, sexual advances, and sexual assault. You could replace Ellen Ripley with a male lead and the result wouldve been the same. Human against Alien. Clarice had to be a woman for the movie to work. Shes the definition of a strong female lead.",
      "My favourite thing about her is how we see her transformation across the two films - starting out as a regular girl working a waitress job, but then going through some serious psychological trauma that she has to either deal with or be broken by... and she chooses to deal with it.\n\n\"You're terminated, fucker\" on paper could be a horrendously cheesy 80s action movie one liner, but her delivery of that line is just so, so perfect. That precise moment is when the real Sarah Connor is born - when she realises she has the strength to fight back.\n\nThen, in T2, she risks losing her humanity as she becomes terminator-like herself in her quest to kill Miles Dyson and avert the war... It's only when she's confronted by her own son that she realises that she - and by extension humanity - is not the same as the Terminators, and there are some lines that can't be crossed.\n\nIf you take both films as one, her story arc is absolutely magnificent and perfectly portrayed by Linda Hamilton.\n\nRipley will always be the goat, but Sarah Connor will always be my favourite.",

    "comments": [
      "I'm going to mention the ones that I don't see either option equally or plausible in further storytelling:\n\n* Rhea Ripley vs Iyo Sky vs Bianca Belair: If Iyo doesn't retain Wrestlemania itself wouldn't be ruined but the story beyond would be seriously damaged. Rhea is my all time favourite women's wrestler but she agreed to drop the title for a reason imo.\n* Gunther vs Jey Uso: If Jey won't win why did we set this match in the first place? If Gunther had to retain he could have someone a lot more established and proven for that person to put them over. But again it wouldn't be end of the world if we are to take it Wrestlemania-specific.\n* Tiffany Stratton vs Charlotte Flair: This is my strongest opinion, TIFFY HAS TO WIN!!! Charlotte carried the feud horribly and ripping the title off from a 25 year old full timer is just criminal. This would actually create Dominik Mysterio level boos.\n* LA Knight vs Jacob Fatu: The only way I see LA Knight(YEAH!!!) retaining is Solo somehow getting involved, ruining the match for Jacob and causing Jacob to turn babyface. But still Jacob Fatu is my horse in this race.\n* AJ Styles vs Logan Paul: I don't want yet another Logan Paul win against hard working full timers, simple as.\n* Rey Mysterio vs El Grande Americano: El Grande Americano has to get unmasked in this match and that makes sense if Rey wins. But the opposite can be worked out with Rey getting infuriated and losing grip etc.",
      "Logan Paul, Charlotte, and Rhea Ripley winning would all suck",
      "Good reasoning OP... I'm heading in to wrestlemania thinking this...\n\nCody/Cena: Cody. I kind of think something may happen where Randy gets his chance and dethrones The American Nightmare, giving him # 15, maybe even a back/forth... getting him to 16, and have Cena 'Shake the hand of who gets # 17, and surpasses him before the door hits him on the way out :) '.\n\nPunk/Reigns/Rollins: I am hoping for ROLLINS. But I'd like them to add a piece to the match. Put Paul Heyman in a cage, and whoever wins retains his services. (Rollins/Heyman could be freakin fun lol! Furthermore, it places Rollins continuously within the warpath of either way how the Dub wants to run it... Reigns or Punk would want retribution at Backlash.\n\nSky/Ripley/Belair: I am hoping for SKY. She could add so much to her resume coming out on top at a triple threat Wrestlemania, involving those 2 women. The way she has been thrown about, she needs to make the exclamation point for the smaller sized women on the roster (the Liv's and Lyra's)... They can still throw down. Kinda vital, when Giulia and Steph Vacquer are on their way... I could see this set up Giulia's promotion to the next level (fighting Joshi style with IYO).\n\nGunther/Jey: Hurmmmm..... Honestly this could be one heck of a legendary match... If Gunther retains. But I do think they're strapping Jey up at Wrestlemania. He's simply earned the chance to run based on how over he has gotten with the fans. The Sales need to matter, because it's what the guys are always saying what matter. (well, that, and POP... Jey's proven that he's got that too).\n\nStratton/Flair: Gotta say STRATTON. I do think Flair is trying to put her over as well.. She knows the whole background thing, I am sure these girls are just cooking an entertaining as anything story right now. Stratton I think they're building to be Flair's true successor... Not that Charlotte is going anywhere right now... But She will have another moment to stap the belt on... and this is a great opportunity to endorse the hard work Trish has put in... Which is very reminiscient of Charlotte Flair. I mean, they're even wearing the same outfits lol!\n\nKnight/Fatu: I see a swerve happening. KNIGHT retains. I agree with OP's opinion that there's flesh on opening up a Solo/Bloodline feud, which might be an amazing cook out. Knight retains at WM , has his moment under the lights... There's plenty of time and enemies to dethrone him through out the next year... Maybe be in the running for a MITB, or large title run. Jacob winning this just FEELS a little too obvious.\n\nIC Fatal 4-way... Bron/Penta/Dom/Finn: This is another one I think is kind of story driven (like LA's belt)... Perhaps the breakup of the Judgement Day? FINN I think may walk out as Champ. I think the big story will be Dom somehow helping Penta, or the other way around. Bron's ready to elevate, and he is a shoe in for being within Gunther/Jey post Wrestlemania. After they need their cool-down. I think Dom's ready for some bigger moments as well... \n\nJade/Naomi: I can't imagine Naomi getting throttled again at the hands of Jade, at a PLE event premium match again. It's another curious one however, because the element to swerve is definitely there. If The triple threat match is on a different night... I could see this match spoiling the triple threat chances of Bianca Belair (having her go full heel turn). Jade loses, but doesn't look bad in doing so, and sets the run to a Jade/Bianca show down... Somewhere down the line.\n\nStyles/Paul: I gotta feeling this one will go to STYLES. He is being severely underplayed around the WWE, and it's time to remind the universe, who is the phenomanal one really is. I believe it'll be a 5-star though... To further build up Logan's resume. I mean, it's ok to have that moment with Ricochet... But the dub can't go on that anymore... I got a feeling this one will have it's moments.\n\nel Grande Americano/Rey Mysterio: hmmm... Tough call what's going on here. But I do think this IS the Gable push that may go somewhere (why else add it to Wrestlemania?) EL GRANDE AMERICANO takes it, and I dont think it will be close. (he may cut a corner or 2)... But Gable looks jacked, there's a reason for it... as for Rey, I'm not sure where he goes entirely... But perhaps this sets him on course to his retirement match (he has said he wants Dom to retire him... I think the Dub will honor that... Word is that he's considering it...)\n\nThe question will be... Who will be the surprises? Stone Cold? The Rock? Becky Lynch? Taker? & where do they fit in to the equation? :)\n\nI have a lot of run-ins... I doubt they're all happening... Just thought where I could see the potential for it.",

      "1. Charlotte winning that's a big one she don't need another one and tired of seeing younger stars get buried \n\n2. Jade and Naomi not opening this match isn't mania worthy and we don't need it in the middle we don't even need it at all this would've been good for bad blood instead \n\n3. Rhea winning I love Rhea but these recent events made her seem desperate we all knew this was gonna go triple threat there was no point in continuing with iyo and Ripley for the title a couple Mondays ago seeing how it was playing out I personally just wanted to see Bianca and iyo and I'm fine with either of them two winning but if Rhea wins that's cool I guess she's still mami \n\n4. Cena not putting his money where his mouth is he better put on a good show and bring that energy with him bc Cody giving him a cross roads with no struggle was like \"that's it?\"",
      "Outcomes that would ruin it......\n\nCharlotte Flair winning (she dont need it)\n\nRhea Ripley winning (sorry shes eating the pin)\n\nFinn Balor winning (hes eating the pin)\n\nLiv Morgan & Raquel Rodriguez losing the belts to any team but Damage CTRL and Wyatt Sicks\n\nNow Naomi beating Cargill would not ruin it for me but it would hurt Jade who needs it more",
      "Here's what I'd like to see:\n\nCena wins and absolutely brutalizes Cody\n\nSomeone else mentioned that Heyman in a cage with the winner getting his services would be cool and I wholeheartedly agree. I just don't like any of the three of them, but I dislike Rollins the most, so I'm hoping Punk wins.\n\nSky needs to keep the belt, Ripley and Belair have been disrespecting her way too much.\n\nI want Jey to win, Gunther is just uninteresting to me\n\nIC Title I think should go to Penta or Dom, but I don't like Dom at all so I want Penta to win. Bron should move up. I think Bron vs Jey would be great to watch.\n\nI'm hoping Logan Paul trips on the entrance ramp and breaks his femur so I don't have to see him again for at least a year. Even better if he's out of wrestling for good. Otherwise I hope Styles just squashes him, Logan Paul is a terrible human being and should just go away.\n\nAs mush as I hate the gimmick, I think El Grande Americano will beat Rey Mysterio.\n\nI don't want Smackdown, so I have no opinion on those matches",
      "Rhoads winning. \nFlair winning.\nDiarrhea Ripley winning. \nLA Knight losing \nPenta winning. \nThe Cargill vs Naomi match actually happening. I guarantee it’s gonna be worse than the Uso’s match last year."

      "1. Denuncia a la pdi\n2. Avisa a banco ripley y pide que anulen tu contrato por falta de consentimiento y anulación de la deuda. No pagues ninguna deuda.\n3. Reclamo al Sernac en paralelo indicando todo el asunto\n4. Informe de deudas a la CMF para revisar si hicieron lo mismo en otro banco\n5. Cambia tu clave única y cedula de identidad porsiacaso\n6. Si el asunto escala y sigue sin resolverse considera abogados",
      "Pon una denuncia por suplantación de identidad, que verifiquen la fecha, firma y datos de quien saco la tarjeta y el recinto donde la sacaron, quizá puedas dar de baja esa deuda debido a que ripley no corroboro los datos correctamente antes de entregar una tarjeta a un extraño suplantandote, además debieron exigir tu cédula al momento de sacar la tarjeta y la huella dactilar, por lo que podrían llegar a saber quien fue",
      "primero primero, revisa el estado de deudas en CMF.\n\n[https://conocetudeuda.cmfchile.cl/informe-deudas/622/w3-contents.html](https://conocetudeuda.cmfchile.cl/informe-deudas/622/w3-contents.html)\n\nve todos tus acreedores, para ver si no tienes una deuda de otro màs\n\nsegundo llama a banco ripley, denuncia el fraude, e indica que detectaste que abrieron una tarjeta a tu nombre. Lo mas probable es que se deba bloquear el plástico.\n\nellos debiesen investigar y ver como fue abierta la tarjeta.\n\n[https://www.cmfchile.cl/portal/principal/613/articles-29072\\_recurso\\_1.pdf](https://www.cmfchile.cl/portal/principal/613/articles-29072_recurso_1.pdf)",
      "A la abuela de mi polola, le sacaron 6 tarjetas ripley con todos los familiares y nadie de la familia fue a pedir nada. \nEstuvieron a punto de hacerle fraude, solo faltaba la firma de ella para autorizar, y se dio cuenta cuando fue a cambiar la tarjeta por que ya no la reconocían en las máquinas.\nBanco ripley no tendría ni cagando.",
      "En este orden tienes que ir:\n\n1. PDI\n2. Reclamo SERNAC\n3. Denuncia en la CMF\n4. Llamar a ripley explicando todo\n\nLiteralmente lo que te acabo de decir es más que nada para flexibilizar el problema ya que los bancos por hacerla larga puede tomarte MESES.\n\nComo dicen otros comentarios arriba dicen que revises deudas y desvincula absolutamente todo de tarjetas en todas las plataformas que tengas.",
      "hace tiempo supe de un tipo de estafa que era cuando en los típicos tramites te piden una foto del carnet por ambos lados y así te sacan cuentas de cuestiones (antiguamente esto estaba relacionado a sacar planes de celular suplantando la identidad con la copia del carnet por ambos lados, usando el numero de serie), no se si pueda llegar a ser el caso, pero a modo de prevención aconsejan escribir encima de la copia del carnet \"uso autorizado solo para\\_\\_\\_\\_\" o derechamente borrar el numero de serie porque francamente para hacer tramites eso no se necesita. Ahora con la estafa yo creo que lo único que procede es denunciar la suplantación de identidad ante la pdi o directamente con fiscalia, de todas formas si no pagas y Ripley quiere perseguir el crédito, tendrían que iniciar procedimientos judiciales de cobro y ahi se podria alegar mejor si ya tienes una denuncia por suplantación de identidad",
      "NO PAGUES, ABSOLUTAMENTE UN CARAJO, SÍ TE TIRAN BOLETIN AL CMF MEDIANTE DICOM, DEMANDA A BANCO RIPLEY, UN ABOGADO TE VA A COBRAR UN 10% DE LO OBTENIDO NO TE VA A COBRAR ALTIRO.\n\nY REALIZA DUNUNCIAS, QUE TENGAS SUERTE Y Q LAMENTABLE SITUACIÓN. 😞",
      "Una vez a mi suegra le robaron su billetera y horas después le solicitaron un avance en ripley jajaj a ella le tramitaban caleta cuando quería solicitarlos, pero a estos nobles ciudadanos se lo autorizaron apenas lo pidieron. Así que pensamos que quizás los de ripley están confabulados porque no tiene ni un sentido la huea",

It looks like you have it just about right.\n\n> You can pick up the tickets at the ticket window two hours before the doors open and up to 30 minutes before the show starts. If you bought with a Ripley Card (not sure what that is, probably a brand name?) you need to present your National ID along with a receipt (I guess you print one off at home). If you bought with Web Pay, you should again present your National ID and receipt. If you aren't the one who paid for the ticket, present a photocopy of the National ID of the person who paid, the printed receipt, and another receipt or document from the buyer saying that they bought the ticket for you.\n\nHope that helps.

There are a few years, like 2014, where I actually have two favorites.\n\nIn 1999 I chose \"Beau Travail\" as my ultimate favorite but of the films released that year, I also considered:\n\nElection - Still a fantastic political satire and I enjoy it even more now that enough time has passed that we can collectively see both characters as (respectively) unethical and immoral, whereas when the film came out it there was a less nuanced conversation about it.\n\nThe Virgin Suicides- A wonderful debut, just so so good. And also kind of funny? Despite the subject matter.\n\nEyes Wide Shut - It's just so beautifully odd and unreal and when looked at for a certain point of view, very prescient.\n\nBeing John Malkovich - Just wildly original. It probably lags behind the others for me because it's so cerebral without the dreaminess that makes me personally prefer Eyes Wide Shut a little more. Basically, Eternal Sunshine is one of my favorite movies of all time and so I guess I prefer the little jolt of romance or \"gauze\" that movies like Eternal Sunshine or Virgin Suicides has.\n\nI've also come to appreciate The Talented Mr.Ripley a LOT more as I've gotten older. I saw it in theaters when it came out and I was a little impatient with it but the alchemic cast is just wild in retrospect, and it's so polished and well done.\n\nIt may actually come down to Beau Travail and Talented Mr.Ripley for me, the more that I think about it. And they're kind of mirrors of each other too.",

      "Oh please, Geena Davis wasn't even nominated for The Fly and she was pregnant with a fly way before Ripley was with a xenomorph.",
      "*Let’s start with the obvious: Sigourney Weaver’s performance in Aliens was nothing short of revolutionary. She played Ellen Ripley not just as a \"final girl\" but as a complex, resilient, and multifaceted character—a true action hero at a time when female action heroes were virtually non-existent. And let’s not forget that she did all of this while contending with a setting that was far more complex and demanding than your typical Oscar bait. We’re talking about a film that challenged gender norms, tackled themes of motherhood, and redefined what it meant to be a \"strong female lead.\"*\n\nHorseshit.  She did the best with what Cameron gave her, but his idea of a strong female lead is \"Mom with a gun.\" Ripley in *Aliens* was all in primary colours compared to the much more believable Ripley of *Alien*.",
      "Sigourney Weaver did a great job in Alien. But it wasn't even remotely a best actress Oscar worthy performance. You're confusing how much you enjoyed the film with the artistic merits of those who made it.\n\nI love Aliens, it's a great film. It deserved attention. But not especially because of Sigourney Weaver's acting. You're confusing her role and what Ripley does in the film with Weaver's acting. You're impressed by Ripley, by the action, the plot, the drama, and forgetting that much of that (not all of that, Sigourney Weaver does do a great job) is created by a sharp script and a well-crafted film helmed by a visually talented director who is able to get great work from his crew.",
      "Ripley wasn't pregnant with a Xenomorph in *Aliens*, you moron. It was a bad dream. Also, *The Fly* wasn't bad but is not remotely *Aliens*.",
      "> Why do you draw a distinction to the \"predictability\" of awarding Marlee Matlin but at the same time say awarding Sigourney would've been revolutionary when awarding both represents awarding something new and unique?\n\nBecause Matlin's film aligns with the *kind of film* the Academy tends to favor. Her status as \"deaf\" gave them a free pass to do what they always do.\n\nChoosing Weaver would have meant validating a *new kind of film*—sci-fi—as a valid artistic artform.\n\n\n> You say the Academy is not comfortable with women who break the mold? They just awarded the first Deaf woman in this category this very year. I'd say that's pretty mold-breaking.\n\nI'm not trying to take away from others. I'm just stating my observations.\n\n> P.S. \"Gorillas in the Mist\" was a much better Weaver performance.\n\n Nah. I can think of other actresses could have played that role. Only Sigourney could sell Ripley in *Aliens.* That makes her the best that year. IMHO.",

En el dunkin encontre gente tela y jefes bacanes pero tuve que renunciar por temas de salud y porque me meti a estudiar (el horario chocaba brijido con el primer año)\nHe buscado que me contraren en Wendys pero no contratan siempre, kfc me da miedo porque esos weones no respetan tu horario y a veces te dejan trabajando hasta las 1 de la mañana sin goce de sueldo por horas extras... \nLlevo desde hace como 3 meses ya postulando para que ripley me contrate (ya que es uno de los lugares que mas me acomoda) pero entraron en <algo que no recuerdo su nombre> y no podían ni echar ni contratar a nadie (y esas weas pueden durar 3 dias como pueden durar años...) he tirado hasta pal metro ksjfjs"

      "Como experiencia reciente compré en Ripley, fue mi primera compra de un producto caro y tecnológico (Había comprado una laptop pero fue recojo en tienda) esta vez fue Delivery y me llegó bien. De alguna manera la persona quién me lo entregó no sabía que contenía el paquete jaja, me dijo \"Ah es un celular?\"\n\nAsí que por experiencia previa es Ripley aunque las otras tiendas mencionadas no he llegado a pedir Delivery"

      "Vi la única foto que muestra una evidencia de la existencia del lugar (esa de las dos niñas en unas estatuillas de las vocales), y eso me recordó que había visto un video en YouTube sobre el Museo de Cera del Puerto de Veracruz, y en una parte de ese video salen esas mismas estatuillas de las vocales en la sección de personajes infantiles del Museo (el video ya tiene tiempo que fue subido a YouTube de una vez lo recalco)  \nNo tiene mucho que fui otra vez al Museo de Cera de Veracruz en este año (junto con el Acuario, el Museo Ripley que remplazo al Puerto de Los Niños, el Túnel Giratorio, el Laberinto de Espejos y la Experiencia 4D), y tal parece que las figuras de cera las cambian al pase del tiempo, porque dichas figuras de las vocales ya no se encontraban en la sección de Personajes Infantiles, y tampoco recuerdo si llegue a ver esas figuras hace 5 años en el mismo museo la primera vez que visite",
      "Yo recuerdo ese lugar fui con mi hermana y un primo he de haber tenido como unos 5 años y ellos 8 pero tengo recuerdo muy claros de que donde esta el ripley era el puerto de los niños tenia varias secciones desde un supermercado hasta una mini disco y una zona donde había maquinitas pero la zona que se me hacia mas inquietante era la de la disco ya que estaba muy sola y daba aires de que te observaban.",

      "Falando de Alien 4.\n\nO Alien 4 é ruim, uma bagunça, o novo Alien e a Ripley clonada é uma merda, e não tem atmosfera nenhuma de Alien, mas pelo menos é um filme minimamente divertido e com personagens e atores interessantes, tem Winona Ryder, tem Ron Perlman, tem que o Gary Dourdan que faz um personagem legal, tem até o Ray Cruz (Tuco de Breaking Bad)\n\nE ele ainda apresenta 2 ideias legais, que são os Autons, máquinas criadas por máquinas que se rebelaram. E o conceito da terra no universo alien, que é mostrada na versão estendida.\n\n\nAgora sobre Alien 3\n\nAcho Alien 3 chatíssimo, ambos os Cuts. A única coisa de salva é o final, que é interessante.\n\nNão consigo me importar com nenhum personagem, o único que era mais interessante morre logo no início, e depois fica só os prisioneiros assassinos e estupradores que eu não ligo se o Alien matar.\n\nO terror e o suspense magistralmente feito no primeiro filme, apesar do filme tentar, não consegui trazer a mesma atsmofera.\n\nÉ um filme que teve um milhão de problemas de produção, e isso fica muito óbvio.\n\nSem falar na pior coisa possível, o que me faz odiar Alien 3 com todas as forças, eles matam o Hicks e a Newt off screen antes do filme começar, puta que pariu.\n\nDisparado uma das piores decisões já tomadas na franquia Alien.",
      "O primeiro ta no meu top10 filmes de todos os tempos, acho realmente uma obra prima. Agora discordo de você sobre o 2, por gostar da trilogia como um todo vejo que ele complementa os outros dois no desenvolvimento da ripley na questão da maternidade e embate às corporações. Não enxergo como algo tão vazio assim, vejo na personagem a bagagem do primeiro filme e isso não é mal explorado na história, talvez só a conveniência do final \"família feliz\" distoe do clima geral.\n\nSobre o post, o início da história do terceiro já estabelecer a ripley como única sobrevivente do 2 me agrada bastante, é como um aviso de que a esperança que você trouxe do outro filme não vai te servir pra nada. Desde o início o clima é bem pra baixo, além da protagonista eu gostava do tywin lannister e pelo que eu lembro ele morre pela metade do filme, mas isso vai fazer sentido no final, onde ninguém que assiste não da razão pro sacrifício da ripley. Claro que iam usar a rainha pra fins bélicos, nesse momento o filme se justifica, mostrar que a única personagem que nós nos importamos tem o mesmo valor nesse universo que os piores tipos de criminosos é o tempero final de desesperança. Pra mim os filmes da trilogia são respectivamente 10; 8,5 e 7. Apesar de gostar do último ainda prefiro o segundo.\n\nSobre os supostos outros filmes da saga assisti só uma vez (o 4 vi duas) por fins de eu gosto do universo, mas são bem porcaria"

      "Probablemente lo que pasó es que la deuda pasó a \"Castigo\", eso significa que por no pago la deuda pasó a ser administrada por una empresa de cobranza, basicamente la figura es que estas empresas de cobranza compran las deudas de gente que ya no paga. La compran a mucho menos precio y tratan de recuperar haciendo planes de pago con el deudor. Una vez que esto ocurre significa que en el bureau financiero el deudor nunca deja de tener la \"marca\" de que fue castigado en una institución financiera, asique es poco probable que le ofrezcan más productos como tarjetas o creditos, o no en el corto plazo al menos. Todo esto es una suposición, porque desconozco si Ripley opera de esta forma, pero he trabajado en banca y la mayoría opera de esta forma"
